    Hello, My name is Tiago Rocha, I am a 26 years old portuguese young man, I am a very curius person, love to learn new things, to try new foods, travel ando go to the gym. <br />
    I am a motivated professional looking to change carrers and start a career in programation. <br />
    I am 100% on what I dedicate my time to, wheter is work or a hobby and wheter I like the task in question or not.<br />
     I believe I have a strong work ethic and I have a passion for problem solving. <br />
    I am a quick learner, with a strong interest in technology, automation, and artificial intelligence. <br />
    I was always passionate about technology and how it can be used to make our lives easier and better in the present and lead the way to shape a better future for everyone, the sky is not the limit, <br />
    not with technology, and in this case programming, imagination is the only limit, as whatever we can imagine we can create, at least digitally. <br />
    I dream of creating a better life for me and every community i get in touch with and I believe that this is the way at lest my way,<br />
    as it is a field that is always evolving and that has a lot of opportunities for growth and development. <br />

For your time and attention, thank you very much.<br />
Best regards, Tiago
